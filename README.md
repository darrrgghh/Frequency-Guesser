# Frequency_Guesser
This is the project of my mini-game called "Frequency Guesser". It is a game to guess frequencies using Python and Pygame.

**Frequency Guesser** is an auditory perception game where players try to guess the frequency of a generated sound.  
The closer your guess is to the actual frequency, the more points you score!

## Features (v0.1)
- Random frequency generation in the **20 Hz â€“ 20,000 Hz** range
- Slider to adjust the guessed frequency
- `Guess!` button to reveal the actual frequency and calculate score
- Informative UI displaying target frequency, guessed frequency, and score
- Additional sliders to adjust volume and frequency range

## Installation & Running
### 1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/darrrgghh/Frequency-Guesser.git
cd Frequency-Guesser
```
### 2. Run the game:
```bash
python Frequency_Guesser.py
```

## Future plans:
- Improve UI/UX
- Add sound visualization
- Implement a leadeboard and, hopefully, multiplayer mode.
## Feel free to share *Your* ideas on what this game should look like!
